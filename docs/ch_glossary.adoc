for the original Forth code. We arrive here from NUMBER which has
made sure that we don't have to deal with a sign and we don't have

6502 Assembly Language Routines", p. 201, where it is called
move left".

`cmove>`:: _ANS string_ ( add1 add2 u -- ) "Copy bytes from high to low"

that entirely matches the beginning of the other string, but is
shorter, is considered less than the longer string.

`compile,`:: _ANS core ext_ ( xt -- ) "Compile xt"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/COMPILEComma
Compile the given xt in the current word definition. It is an
error if we are not in the compile state. Because we are using
subroutine threading, we can't use , (COMMA) to compile new words
the traditional way. By default, native compiled is allowed, unless
there is a NN (Never Native) flag associated. If not, we use the
value NC_LIMIT (from definitions.tasm) to decide if the code
is too large to be natively coded: If the size is larger than
NC_LIMIT, we silently use subroutine coding. If the AN (Always
Native) flag is set, the word is always natively compiled.

`compile-only`:: _Tali Forth_ ( -- ) "Mark most recent word as COMPILE-ONLY"
Set the Compile Only flag (CO) of the most recently defined
word.

`constant`:: _ANS core_ ( n "name" -- ) "Define a constant"

Inspired by the pForth instruction DIGIT, see
https://github.com/philburk/pforth/blob/master/fth/numberio.fth
Rewritten from DIGIT>NUMBER in Tali Forth. Note in contrast to
pForth, we get the base (radix) ourselves instead of having the
user provide it. There is no standard name for this routine, which
itself is not ANS; we use DIGIT? following pForth and Gforth.

`disasm`:: _Tali Forth_ ( addr u -- ) "Disassemble a block of memory"

`endof`:: _ANS core ext_ (C: case-sys1 of-sys1-- case-sys2) ( -- ) "Conditional flow control"
http://forth-standard.org/standard/core/ENDOF
This is a dummy entry, the code is shared with ELSE

`enter-screen`:: _Tali Editor_ ( scr# -- ) "Enter all lines for given screen"
`environment?`:: _ANS core_ ( addr u -- 0 | i*x true )  "Return system information"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/ENVIRONMENTq

`erase`:: _ANS core ext_ ( addr u -- ) "Fill memory region with zeros"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/ERASE
Note that ERASE works with "address" units
(bytes), not cells.

`erase-screen`:: _Tali Editor_ ( scr# -- ) "Erase all lines for given screen"
`evaluate`:: _ANS core_ ( addr u -- ) "Execute a string"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/EVALUATE
Set SOURCE-ID to -1, make addr u the input source, set >IN to zero.
After processing the line, revert to old input source. We use this
to compile high-level Forth words and user-defined words during
start up and cold boot. In contrast to ACCEPT, we need to, uh,
accept more than 255 characters here, even though it's a pain in
the 8-bit.

`execute`:: _ANS core_ ( xt -- ) "Jump to word based on execution token"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/EXECUTE

`execute-parsing`:: _Gforth_ ( addr u xt -- ) "Pass a string to a parsing word"
https://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/gforth/Docs-html/The-Input-Stream.html
Execute the parsing word defined by the execution token (xt) on the
string as if it were passed on the command line. See the file
tests/tali.fs for examples.

`exit`:: _ANS core_ ( -- ) "Return control to the calling word immediately"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/EXIT
If we're in a loop, we need to UNLOOP first and get everything
we we might have put on the Return Stack off as well. This should
be natively compiled.

`false`:: _ANS core ext_ ( -- f ) "Push flag FALSE to Data Stack"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/FALSE

`fill`:: _ANS core_ ( addr u char -- ) "Fill a memory region with a character"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/FILL
Fill u bytes of memory with char starting at addr. Note that
this works on bytes, not on cells. On an 8-bit machine such as the
65c02, this is a serious pain in the rear. It is not defined what
happens when we reach the end of the address space

`find`:: _ANS core_ ( caddr -- addr 0 | xt 1 | xt -1 ) "Find word in Dictionary"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/FIND
Included for backwards compatibility only, because it still
can be found in so may examples. It should, however, be replaced
by FIND-NAME. Counted string either returns address with a FALSE
flag if not found in the Dictionary, or the xt with a flag to
indicate if this is immediate or not. FIND is a wrapper around
FIND-NAME, we get this all over with as quickly as possible. See
https://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/gforth/Docs-html/Word-Lists.html
https://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/gforth/Docs-html/Name-token.html

`forth`:: _ANS search ext_ ( -- ) "Replace first WID in search order with Forth-Wordlist"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/search/FORTH

`forth-wordlist`:: _ANS search_ ( -- u ) "WID for the Forth Wordlist"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/search/FORTH-WORDLIST
This is a dummy entry, the actual code is shared with ZERO.

`get-current`:: _ANS search_ ( -- wid ) "Get the id of the compilation wordlist"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/search/GET-CURRENT

`get-order`:: _ANS search_ ( -- wid_n .. wid_1 n) "Get the current search order"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/search/GET-ORDER

`here`:: _ANS core_ ( -- addr ) "Put Compiler Pointer on Data Stack"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/HERE
This code is also used by the assembler directive ARROW
("->") though as immediate

`hex`:: _ANS core ext_ ( -- ) "Change base radix to hexadecimal"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/HEX

`hexstore`:: _Tali_ ( addr1 u1 addr2 -- u2 ) "Store a list of numbers"
Given a string addr1 u1 with numbers in the current base seperated
by spaces, store the numbers at the address addr2, returning the
number of elements. Non-number elements are skipped, an zero-length
string produces a zero output.

`hold`:: _ANS core_ ( char -- ) "Insert character at current output"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/HOLD
Insert a character at the current position of a pictured numeric
output string on
https://github.com/philburk/pforth/blob/master/fth/numberio.fth

`i`:: _ANS core_ ( -- n )(R: n -- n)  "Copy loop counter to stack"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/I
Note that this is not the same as R@ because we use a fudge
factor for loop control; see the Control Flow section of the
manual for details.

`if`:: _ANS core_ (C: -- orig) (flag -- ) "Conditional flow control"
http://forth-standard.org/standard/core/IF

`immediate`:: _ANS core_ ( -- ) "Mark most recent word as IMMEDIATE"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/IMMEDIATE
Make sure the most recently defined word is immediate. Will only
affect the last word in the dictionary. Note that if the word is
defined in ROM, this will have no affect, but will not produce an
error message.

`input`:: _Tali Forth_ ( -- addr ) "Return address of input vector"
`input>r`:: _Tali Forth_ ( -- ) ( R: -- n n n n ) "Save input state to the Return Stack"
Save the current input state as defined by insrc, cib, ciblen, and
toin to the Return Stack. Used by EVALUTE.

`int>name`:: _Tali Forth_ ( xt -- nt ) "Get name token from execution token"
www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/gforth/Docs-html/Name-token.html
This is called >NAME in Gforth, but we change it to
INT>NAME to match NAME>INT

`invert`:: _ANS core_ ( n -- n ) "Complement of TOS"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/INVERT

`is`:: _ANS core ext_ ( xt "name" -- ) "Set named word to execute xt"
http://forth-standard.org/standard/core/IS

`j`:: _ANS core_ ( -- n ) (R: n -- n ) "Copy second loop counter to stack"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/J
Copy second loop counter from Return Stack to stack. Note we use
a fudge factor for loop control; see the Control Flow section of
the manual for more details.
At this point, we have the "I" counter/limit and the LEAVE address
on the stack above this (three entries), whereas the ideal Forth
implementation would just have two.

`key`:: _ANS core_ ( -- char ) "Get one character from the input"
`l`:: _Tali Editor_ ( -- ) "List the current screen"
`latestnt`:: _Tali Forth_ ( -- nt ) "Push most recent nt to the stack"
www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/gforth/Docs-html/Name-token.html
The Gforth version of this word is called LATEST

`latestxt`:: _Gforth_ ( -- xt ) "Push most recent xt to the stack"
http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/gforth/Docs-html/Anonymous-Definitions.html

`leave`:: _ANS core_ ( -- ) "Leave DO/LOOP construct"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/LEAVE
Note that this does not work with anything but a DO/LOOP in
contrast to other versions such as discussed at
http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ashleyf/archive/2011/02/06/loopty-do-i-loop.aspx

`line`:: _Tali Editor_ ( line# -- c-addr ) "Turn a line number into address in current screen"
`list`:: _ANS block ext_ ( scr# -- ) "List the given screen"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/block/LIST

`literal`:: _ANS core_ ( n -- ) "Store TOS to be push on stack during runtime"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/LITERAL
Compile-only word to store TOS so that it is pushed on stack
during runtime. This is a immediate, compile-only word. At runtime,
it works by calling literal_runtime by compling JSR LITERAL_RT.

`load`:: _ANS block_ ( scr# -- ) "Load the Forth code in a screen/block"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/block/LOAD

`loop`:: _ANS core_ ( -- ) "Finish loop construct"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/LOOP
Compile-time part of LOOP. This does nothing more but push 1 on
the stack and then call +LOOP.

`lshift`:: _ANS core_ ( x u -- u ) "Shift TOS left"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/LSHIFT

`m*`:: _ANS core_ ( n n -- d ) "16 * 16 --> 32"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/MTimes
Multiply two 16 bit numbers, producing a 32 bit result. All
values are signed. Adapted from FIG Forth for Tali Forth.

`marker`:: _ANS core ext_ ( "name" -- ) "Create a deletion boundry"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/MARKER
This word replaces FORGET in earlier Forths. Old entries are not
actually deleted, but merely overwritten by restoring CP and DP.
Run the named word at a later time to restore all of the wordlists
to their state when the word was created with marker.  Any words
created after the marker (including the marker) will be forgotten.

`max`:: _ANS core_ ( n n -- n ) "Keep larger of two numbers"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/MAX
Compare TOS and NOS and keep which one is larger. Adapted from
Lance A. Leventhal "6502 Assembly Language Subroutines". Negative
Flag indicates which number is larger. See also
http://6502.org/tutorials/compare_instructions.html and
http://www.righto.com/2012/12/the-6502-overflow-flag-explained.html

`min`:: _ANS core_ ( n n -- n ) "Keep smaller of two numbers"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/MIN
Adapted from Lance A. Leventhal "6502 Assembly Language
Subroutines." Negative Flag indicateds which number is larger. See
http://www.righto.com/2012/12/the-6502-overflow-flag-explained.html

`mod`:: _ANS core_ ( n1 n2 -- n ) "Divide NOS by TOS and return the remainder"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/MOD

`move`:: _ANS core_ ( addr1 addr2 u -- ) "Copy bytes"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/MOVE
Copy u "address units" from addr1 to addr2. Since our address
units are bytes, this is just a front-end for CMOVE and CMOVE>. This
is actually the only one of these three words that is in the CORE
set.

`name>int`:: _Gforth_ ( nt -- xt ) "Convert Name Token to Execute Token"
See
https://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/gforth/Docs-html/Name-token.html

`name>string`:: _Gforth_ ( nt -- addr u ) "Given a name token, return string of word"
http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/gforth/Docs-html/Name-token.html

`nc-limit`:: _Tali Forth_ ( -- addr ) "Return address where NC-LIMIT value is kept"
`negate`:: _ANS core_ ( n -- n ) "Two's complement"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/NEGATE

`never-native`:: _Tali Forth_ ( -- ) "Flag last word as never natively compiled"
`nip`:: _ANS core ext_ ( b a -- a ) "Delete NOS"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/NIP

`number`:: _Tali Forth_ ( addr u -- u | d ) "Convert a number string"
Convert a number string to a double or single cell number. This
is a wrapper for >NUMBER and follows the convention set out in the
Forth Programmer's Handbook" (Conklin & Rather) 3rd edition p. 87.
Based in part on the "Starting Forth" code
https://www.forth.com/starting-forth/10-input-output-operators/
Gforth uses S>NUMBER? and S>UNUMBER? which return numbers and a flag
https://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/gforth/Docs-html/Number-Conversion.html
Another difference to Gforth is that we follow ANS Forth that the
dot to signal a double cell number is required to be the last
character of the string.

`o`:: _Tali Editor_ ( line# -- ) "Overwrite the given line"
`of`:: _ANS core ext_ (C: -- of-sys) (x1 x2 -- |x1) "Conditional flow control"
http://forth-standard.org/standard/core/OF

`only`:: _ANS search ext_ ( -- ) "Set earch order to minimum wordlist"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/search/ONLY

`or`:: _ANS core_ ( m n -- n ) "Logically OR TOS and NOS"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/OR

`order`:: _ANS core_ ( -- ) "Print current word order list and current WID"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/search/ORDER
Note the search order is displayed from first search to last
searched and is therefore exactly the reverse of the order in which
Forth stacks are displayed.

`output`:: _Tali Forth_ ( -- addr ) "Return the address of the EMIT vector address"
`over`:: _ANS core_ ( b a -- b a b ) "Copy NOS to TOS"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/OVER

`pad`:: _ANS core ext_ ( -- addr ) "Return address of user scratchpad"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/PAD
Return address to a temporary area in free memory for user. Must
be at least 84 bytes in size (says ANS). It is located relative to
the compile area pointer (CP) and therefore varies in position.
This area is reserved for the user and not used by the system

`page`:: _ANS facility_ ( -- ) "Clear the screen"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/facility/PAGE
Clears a page if supported by ANS terminal codes. This is
Clear Screen ("ESC[2J") plus moving the cursor to the top
left of the screen

`parse`:: _ANS core ext_ ( "name" c -- addr u ) "Parse input with delimiter character"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/PARSE
Find word in input string delimited by character given. Do not
skip leading delimiters -- this is the main difference to PARSE-NAME.
PARSE and PARSE-NAME replace WORD in modern systems. ANS discussion
http://www.forth200x.org/documents/html3/rationale.html#rat:core:PARSE

`parse-name`:: _ANS core ext_ ( "name" -- addr u ) "Parse the input"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/PARSE-NAME
Find next word in input string, skipping leading whitespace. This is
a special form of PARSE and drops through to that word. See PARSE
for more detail. We use this word internally for the interpreter
because it is a lot easier to use. Reference implementations at
http://forth-standard.org/standard/core/PARSE-NAME and
http://www.forth200x.org/reference-implementations/parse-name.fs
Roughly, the word is comparable to BL WORD COUNT. -- Note that
though the ANS standard talks about skipping "spaces", whitespace
is actually perfectly legal (see for example
http://forth-standard.org/standard/usage#subsubsection.3.4.1.1).
Otherwise, PARSE-NAME chokes on tabs.

`pick`:: _ANS core ext_ ( n n u -- n n n ) "Move element u of the stack to TOS"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/PICK
Take the u-th element out of the stack and put it on TOS,
overwriting the original TOS. 0 PICK is equivalent to DUP, 1 PICK to
OVER. Note that using PICK is considered poor coding form. Also note
that FIG Forth has a different behavior for PICK than ANS Forth.

`postpone`:: _ANS core_ ( -- ) "Change IMMEDIATE status (it's complicated)"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/POSTPONE
Add the compilation behavior of a word to a new word at
compile time. If the word that follows it is immediate, include
it so that it will be compiled when the word being defined is
itself used for a new word. Tricky, but very useful.

`previous`:: _ANS search ext_ ( -- ) "Remove the first wordlist in the search order"
http://forth-standard.org/standard/search/PREVIOUS

`quit`:: _ANS core_ ( -- ) "Reset the input and get new input"

`r>input`:: _Tali Forth_ ( -- ) ( R: n n n n -- ) "Restore input state from Return Stack"
Restore the current input state as defined by insrc, cib, ciblen,
and toin from the Return Stack.

`r@`:: _ANS core_ ( -- n ) "Get copy of top of Return Stack"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/RFetch
This word is Compile Only in Tali Forth, though Gforth has it
work normally as well

`recurse`:: _ANS core_ ( -- ) "Copy recursive call to word being defined"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/RECURSE

`refill`:: _ANS core ext_ ( -- f ) "Refill the input buffer"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/REFILL
Attempt to fill the input buffer from the input source, returning
a true flag if successful. When the input source is the user input
device, attempt to receive input into the terminal input buffer. If
successful, make the result the input buffer, set >IN to zero, and
return true. Receipt of a line containing no characters is considered
successful. If there is no input available from the current input
source, return false. When the input source is a string from EVALUATE,
return false and perform no other action." See
https://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/gforth/Docs-html/The-Input-Stream.html
and Conklin & Rather p. 156. Note we don't have to care about blocks
because REFILL is never used on blocks - Tali is able to evaluate the
entire block as a 1024 byte string.

`repeat`:: _ANS core_ (C: orig dest -- ) ( -- ) "Loop flow control"
http://forth-standard.org/standard/core/REPEAT

`root-wordlist`:: _Tali Editor_ ( -- u ) "WID for the Root (minimal) wordlist"
`rot`:: _ANS core_ ( a b c -- b c a ) "Rotate first three stack entries downwards"

https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/RSHIFT

`s"`:: _ANS core_ ( "string" -- )( -- addr u ) "Store string in memory"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/Sq
Store address and length of string given, returning ( addr u ).
ANS core claims this is compile-only, but the file set expands it
to be interpreted, so it is a state-sensitive word, which in theory
are evil. We follow general usage.

`s>d`:: _ANS core_ ( u -- d ) "Convert single cell number to double cell"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/StoD

`s\"`:: _ANS core_ ( "string" -- )( -- addr u ) "Store string in memory"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/Seq
Store address and length of string given, returning ( addr u ).
ANS core claims this is compile-only, but the file set expands it
to be interpreted, so it is a state-sensitive word, which in theory
are evil. We follow general usage. This is just like S" except
that it allows for some special escaped characters.

`save-buffers`:: _ANS block_ ( -- ) "Save all dirty buffers to storage"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/block/SAVE-BUFFERS

`scr`:: _ANS block ext_ ( -- addr ) "Push address of variable holding last screen listed"

`search`:: _ANS string_ ( addr1 u1 addr2 u2 -- addr3 u3 flag) "Search for a substring"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/string/SEARCH
Search for string2 (denoted by addr2 u2) in string1 (denoted by
addr1 u1). If a match is found the flag will be true and
addr3 will have the address of the start of the match and u3 will have
the number of characters remaining from the match point to the end
of the original string1. If a match is not found, the flag will be
false and addr3 and u3 will be the original string1's addr1 and u1.

`search-wordlist`:: _ANS search_ ( caddr u wid -- 0 | xt 1 | xt -1) "Search for a word in a wordlist"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/search/SEARCH_WORDLIST

`see`:: _ANS tools_ ( "name" -- ) "Print information about a Forth word"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/tools/SEE
SEE takes the name of a word and prints its name token (nt),
execution token (xt), size in bytes, flags used, and then dumps the
code and disassembles it.

https://forth-standard.org/standard/search/SET-CURRENT

`set-order`:: _ANS search_ ( wid_n .. wid_1 n -- ) "Set the current search order"

`source`:: _ANS core_ ( -- addr u ) "Return location and size of input buffer""
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/SOURCE

`source-id`:: _ANS core ext_ ( -- n ) "Return source identifier"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/SOURCE-ID Identify the
input source unless it is a block (s. Conklin & Rather p. 156). This
will give the input source: 0 is keyboard, -1 ($FFFF) is character
string, and a text file gives the fileid.

`space`:: _ANS core_ ( -- ) "Print a single space"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/SPACE

`spaces`:: _ANS core_ ( u -- ) "Print a number of spaces"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/SPACES

`state`:: _ANS core_ ( -- addr ) "Return the address of compilation state flag"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/STATE
STATE is true when in compilation state, false otherwise. Note
we do not return the state itself, but only the address where
it lives. The state should not be changed directly by the user; see
http://forth.sourceforge.net/standard/dpans/dpans6.htm#6.1.2250

`strip-underflow`:: _Tali Forth_ ( -- addr ) "Return address where underflow status is kept"

Old Forth versions such as FIG Forth call this U*

`um/mod`:: _ANS core_ ( ud u -- ur u ) "32/16 -> 16 division"
https://forth-standard.org/standard/core/UMDivMOD
Divide double cell number by single cell number, returning the
quotient as TOS and any remainder as NOS. All numbers are unsigned.

Obsolete parsing word included for backwards compatibility only.
Do not use this, use `PARSE` or `PARSE-NAME`. Skips leading delimiters
and copies word to storage area for a maximum size of 255 bytes.
Returns the result as a counted string (requires COUNT to convert
to modern format), and inserts a space after the string. See "Forth
Programmer's Handbook" 3rd edition p. 159 and
http://www.forth200x.org/documents/html/rationale.html#rat:core:PARSE
for discussions of why you shouldn't be using WORD anymore.

Given an word's name token (nt), return the size of the
word's payload size in bytes (CFA plus PFA) in bytes. Does not
