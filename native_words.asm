; Low-level Forth word routines
; Tali Forth 2 for the 65c02
; Scot W. Stevenson <scot.stevenson@gmail.com>
; First version: 19. Jan 2014
; This version: 18. Dec 2018

; The skeleton for this file was generated by a script. See the tools folder
; for more information

; This list is ordered alphabetically by the names of the words, not their
; strings (so "!" is sorted as "store"). However, we start off with COLD,
; ABORT and QUIT as the natural start sequence. Each word two special status
; line that begins with "; ## " and allows auto-generation of the WORDLIST.md
; file in the docs folder. Status entries are 
;
;       TBA --> fragment --> coded --> tested --> auto
;
; "auto" means that the word is automatically tested by the test suite (good),
; "tested" means that it was tested by hand in some way (okay), "coded" means
; it hasn't been tested at all (bad). See the test suite for more details.
